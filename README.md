ðŸ§ ðŸš— NeuroCar: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) RC Car

A hands-free vehicle control system powered by EEG brain signals and facial expressions, integrating the EMOTIV EPOC X headset with Arduino to create a prototype for assistive technology.

ðŸ§© Overview

This project explores the development of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) controlled RC car that translates facial expressions into real-time motion commands. Designed for inclusivity, it provides a non-invasive control method for individuals with physical disabilities using EEG signal classification.
